<p>The incident happened over a month ago, and it was incredibly embarrassing.</p>
<p>I turned to <strong>Jia</strong> for help because there was something specific that needed to be presented on the poster. I told her that I would message her when I arrived at the Science &amp; Technology building. That was the plan I came up with.</p>
<p>The next morning, however, even after being there for at least two hours, I didn’t take any action, <strong>not even</strong> sending her a WeChat message. She waited, and she kept waiting for me <strong>all morning</strong>. Um, there’s no doubt that I ignored and hurt her, as well as our friendship and trust. I treated everything so casually.</p>
<p>How I could take such an attitude to deal with… <strong>All my fault</strong>.</p>
<p>Jia，非常抱歉。一万个抱歉，以及想找个地缝马上钻进去。很不好的感觉，不要这样对待别人啊，说的就是我。:anxious_face_with_sweat::anxious_face_with_sweat: 浪费别人的心情，浪费别人的心情，浪费别人的心情。不只是心情，涉及的太多了，时间、信任、以及别人帮助你的意愿、、、这些并不是理所当然的事情。</p>
<p>取得一个人的信任很难，但失去一个人的信任却很容易。不要这样对待别人啊啊啊啊。</p>
<p>与自己共勉。</p>
