<p>It’s the new year’s day today. On my way to the new year’s visit, however, the message “iPhone Unavailable…” appears on the phone screen.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with it? Whether it will be permanently locked and turn into a “brick”（砖头）.</p>
<p><img src="images/wx_20230122172239.jpg" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>Subsequently, what I could try is to restart it, but it still didn’t work. So I have to wait to see what will happen next, after the timer ran out.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Thank heaven. It could be accessed by typing the correct password.</p>
<p>But, what caused this interface? I searched “iPhone Unavailable” on Bing, and found that the phone was mistakenly touched many times in my pocket. Simultaneously I recalled the vibration my hand felt this morning from phone when entering the incorrect password.</p>
<p>突然悟了</p>
<p><strong>What a fool I am.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “iPhone Unavailable” black screen appears after too many wrong passcode attempts.</p>
