**Hugo, the world's fastest framework for building websites.**


Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the [Apache Licence 2.0.](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE) **Hugo supports** TOML, YAML and JSON data file types, Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes to add rich content. **Other notable features** are taxonomies, multilingual mode, image processing, custom output formats, HTML/CSS/JS minification and support for Sass SCSS workflows.



**Hugo is ideal for** blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.



Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and **can be deployed anywhere including**, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
